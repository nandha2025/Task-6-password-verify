Brute force: 
The attacker systematically tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found; short and simple passwords can be cracked in seconds or minutes using automated tools
Dictionary attack:
Instead of all combinations, the attacker uses wordlists of common passwords and phrases (like “123456”, “password”, names, seasons+year, etc.), making it very effective against weak, human‑style passwords
Offline hash cracking: 
If an attacker steals a password database, they can crack weak hashed passwords very quickly with GPUs and tools like hashcat using brute force, dictionaries, and rules, without triggering lockouts or rate limits
