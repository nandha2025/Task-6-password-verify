# 🔐 Task 6 – Strong Password Creation & Evaluation

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains my work for **Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength** from the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship. The goal is to understand what makes a password strong, test different passwords using online tools, and document best practices for secure password creation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Create multiple passwords with varying **length** and **complexity**  
- Test each password using **online password strength checkers**  
- Record **scores**, **ratings**, and **feedback** from the tools  
- Identify **best practices** for strong password creation  
- Study **common password attacks** and how password complexity affects security

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Resources

- Online password strength checkers, for example:  
  - `passwordmeter.com`  
  - Any other free password strength meter used during testing  
- Web browser for research on password attacks and best practices  
- Text editor / Markdown editor for documentation


### 📄 password-tests.md

- List of sample passwords (no real passwords used).  
- Table with:
  - Password (or pattern)
  - Length
  - Strength score / rating
  - Tool used
  - Feedback or comments  
- Observations on how:
  - Length
  - Character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)
  - Use of words vs random strings / passphrases  
  impact password strength.

### 🖼️ screenshots/

- Contains screenshots of password strength meter outputs for each tested password.  
- File names can follow a simple pattern, for example:  
  - `weak-password-1.png`  
  - `strong-password-3.png`  
  - `passphrase'

## 🔍 Methodology

1. Created multiple sample passwords with varying:
   - Length (short, medium, long)
   - Complexity (only letters vs letters + numbers + symbols)
   - Style (single words, combinations, passphrase-like)

2. Tested each password using one or more online password strength tools.

3. Recorded for each password:
   - Score or rating (e.g., Weak, Medium, Strong, Very Strong, or percentage)
   - Feedback messages (e.g., “too short”, “common word”, “good length and complexity”)

4. Analyzed patterns to see how password length and complexity affect resistance to:
   - Brute force attacks
   - Dictionary attacks
   - Other common password-guessing techniques

## 🔒 Key Learnings & Best Practices

- Prefer **long passwords or passphrases** (ideally 12+ characters).  
- Use a mix of **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**.  
- Avoid common words, predictable patterns, names, and dates.  
- Do **not reuse passwords** across different websites or services.  
- Use a **password manager** to store unique, complex passwords.  
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** wherever possible for extra security.

## 📖 How to Use This Repository

- Open `password-tests.md` to review:
  - All tested passwords (or patterns)
  - Their strength scores and ratings
  - Analysis and observations

- Open `screenshots/` to view visual outputs from password strength tools.

- Open `interview-questions.md` to quickly revise theory and interview answers related to password strength, attacks, and best practices.
